Project 1: Spam Detection
Overview
This project involves creating a spam detection system using machine learning algorithms. The goal is to classify text messages as either "spam" or "ham" (non-spam).

Installation
To set up the environment for this project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repository-name.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd repository-name
Create and activate a virtual environment (optional):
bash
Copy code
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use .\env\Scripts\activate
Install the required packages:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run the spam detection script:

bash
Copy code
python spam_detection.py
Data
Dataset Name: spam.csv
Description: Contains text messages labeled as "spam" or "ham."
Algorithms
The following algorithms were used:

Naive Bayes
Random Forest
K-Nearest Neighbors
Results
Naive Bayes: Accuracy of 93.86%
Random Forest: Accuracy of 96.49%
K-Nearest Neighbors: Accuracy of 96.49%
Project 2: Breast Cancer Detection
Overview
This project focuses on detecting breast cancer using machine learning algorithms. The objective is to classify tumors as either benign or malignant.

Installation
To set up the environment for this project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repository-name.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd repository-name
Create and activate a virtual environment (optional):
bash
Copy code
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use .\env\Scripts\activate
Install the required packages:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run the breast cancer detection script:

bash
Copy code
python breast_cancer_detection.py
Data
Dataset Name: B-cancer.csv
Description: Contains features of breast cancer tumors with labels indicating benign or malignant.
Algorithms
The following algorithms were used:

Logistic Regression
Naive Bayes
Random Forest
K-Nearest Neighbors
Results
Logistic Regression: Accuracy of 95.61%
Naive Bayes: Accuracy of 93.86%
Random Forest: Accuracy of 96.49%
K-Nearest Neighbors: Accuracy of 96.49%
